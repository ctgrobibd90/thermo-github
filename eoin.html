    <h5>Biography</h5>
    <p>
      Eoin Oude Essink holds a BA, BAI, and MAI in Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering from Trinity College Dublin. He has always had a strong interest in thermodynamics, alongside a personal passion for technology and electronics. He combined these interests during his masterâ€™s research project, where he conducted a numerical study on the microscale modulation of heat transfer caused by movable parts in a liquid-cooled server CPU. This research was carried out under the supervision of Dr. Sajad Alimohammadi and Dr. Tim Persoons.

Eoin is currently pursuing a PhD at TU Dublin, where his research focuses on developing the most suitable cooling technologies for Irish data centres. His project involves both experimental and numerical studies to identify effective and efficient cooling solutions. The research also involves collaboration with existing state-of-the-art colocation data centres in Ireland.

The project aims to determine the most appropriate cooling methods for next-generation data centres in Ireland and to assess how newer technologies can reduce total cost of ownership.

During his undergraduate studies, Eoin spent time at TU Delft's Mechanical Engineering department and completed a research project on autonomous vehicles in collaboration with ZF in Germany. After graduation, he worked as a thermal engineer at a cryogenics company in the Netherlands, where he developed numerical tools to support the design phase of new products by estimating heat transfer characteristics.

In September 2020, he returned to Dublin to begin his PhD research at TU Dublin. In 2023, Eoin joined the Cooling Technologies Research Center at Purdue University as part of his Fulbright Scholarship. There, he collaborated with Prof. Justin Weibel to develop an experimental facility aimed at improving the understanding of offset strip fin performance.
