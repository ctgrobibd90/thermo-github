    <h5>Biography</h5>
    <p>
      Sidharth P. Raut is a highly skilled Computational Engineer with 8+ years of expertise in fluid dynamics, thermal sciences, and signal processing. He has led high-impact R&D projects for industry leaders like ADA, DRDL, and EI, specializing in numerical modeling, experimental rig design, and regulatory documentation.

Proficient in CFD/CAD tools (ANSYS, OpenFOAM, Siemens Star CCM+, SolidWorks), programming (Python, MATLAB, C), and data analytics, he seamlessly integrates computational and experimental approaches to tackle complex engineering challenges. Certified in HyperMesh, Siemens Star CCM+, and NI LabVIEW, he holds good command in numerical simulations and signal processing.

He is pursuing PhD in Mechanical Engineering from Technological University Dublin, where his research focuses on sessile droplet evaporation under electric fields and microgravity, contributing to thermal management advancements for space and industrial applications. He earned an M.Sc. in Computational Fluid Dynamics from Cranfield University and a B. Tech in Aeronautical Engineering from JNTU Hyderabad, equipping him with a strong foundation in advanced fluid dynamics and numerical modeling.

Currently, as a Research Assistant at TU Dublin, he is pioneering the development of a next-generation atherectomy device for critical limb ischemia under VascuSense project in collaboration with Versono Medical Ltd., Integer Ireland Medical Ltd., and Enterprise Ireland.

Previously, he worked on regenerative heaters for scramjet engines (DRDL) and proton transport mechanisms (Syracuse University), with published work in Langmuir and ILASS Europe. Known for his technical excellence, innovation, and problem-solving, he thrives at the intersection of computational science and real-world engineering.
